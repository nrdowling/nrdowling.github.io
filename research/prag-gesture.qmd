Children begin using pragmatic co-speech gestures at the earliest stages of language development. Well before toddlers create their first two-words utterances, they use conventionalized gestures like shoulder shrugs, wrist flips, and head nods and shakes to communicate epistemic and affective states. Soon after they use these same movements as “beats” to complement prosody and emphasize words. Eventually, they will use these gestures with a high degree of flexibility in both form and function: a twitch of one shoulder and a tilt of the head to express disinterest, a palm up and extended toward their listener to pass the turn, a series of small nods to indicate comprehension through backchannel feedback. 

Although children seem to have near mastery of many aspects of their native language before they even begin formal schooling, we know the developmental trajectory of pragmatics extends well into adolescence. We use data from the Language Development Project’s corpus of spontaneous, parent-child interaction in early childhood to explore how co-speech gestures fit into the emergence of these skills. In my dissertation research, I ask how these gestures continue to develop into the middle school years in our corpus of parent-child cooperative tasks.
