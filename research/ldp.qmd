The University of Chicagoâ€™s Language Development Project (LDP) is a longitudinal study of language and learning, following over 100 children and their families from 14 months through young adulthood. The LDP dataset includes a corpus of spontaneous parent-child in-home language and gesture as well as standardized assessments, qualitative surveys, and educational outcomes.  I began work with the Language Development Project as a research assistant in 2010 and as a graduate student researcher in 2016. My recent work explores the development of pragmatic gestures like shrug and palm-ups from infancy to early adolescence.
