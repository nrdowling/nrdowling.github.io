Language enables humans to communicate infinitely complex ideas in neatly packaged strings of words, but these words are neither delivered nor received in a vacuum. In day-to-day conversation, the language we use is part of a larger interactive context. As speakers and signers, our bodies, faces, voices, and histories send messages above and beyond the words we choose. By broadening the scope of how we think about dialogue, we can examine conversation as a multifaceted event - where language is just one of many ways we communicate. 

This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of conversation to ask how identity, society, and the physical world allow us to make meaning from language. We discuss how the study of interactional context varies across linguistics, psychology, and sociology and think critically about the overlap and divergence we find across these perspectives. Over the quarter students build an interdisciplinary analysis of a single interaction by examining and reexamining data through lenses such as coordinated turn-taking, social distance, barriers to communication, and gesture.
