That means:\n\nThere are major changes to the structure of the class for Winter 2025! So if you’re planning to take the course next Winter don’t be misled by what you see here.\nThere are very likely lots of broken links, css, and bootstrap elements as a result of the quick and dirty migration from the old-school RMarkdown format to the Quarto format used on this site. This is a temporary site and I’m not going to fix them.\nFrom Data to Manuscript (D2M) in R\nWinter 2024: CHDV 20550/30550, MACS 30550, MAPS 30550, PSYC 20550/30550"

    "text": "Overview\n\nDescription\nThis course tackles the basic skills needed to build an integrated research report with the R programming language. We will cover every step from data to manuscript including: Using R’s libraries to clean up and re-format messy datasets, preparing data sets for analysis, running statistical tools, generating clear and attractive figures and tables, and knitting those bits of code together with your manuscript writing. The result will be a reproducible, open-science friendly report that you can easily update after finishing data collection or receiving comments from readers. Never copy-paste your way through a table again! The R universe is large, so this course will focus specifically on: The core R libraries, the tidyverse library, and R Markdown. Students will also learn about the use of GitHub for version control.\n\nWeekly meetings:\n\nTuesdays and Thursdays 11am - 12:20pm\n1155 E 60th St, Room 289B\n\n\n\nInstructor:\n\nDr. Natalie Dowling\nEmail: ndowling@uchicago.edu\nGitHub: @nrdowling\nOffice: 1155 Building, Room 404\nOffice hours: Tues/Thurs 4pm - 5pm - sign up via GCal\n\n\n\nTeaching assistant:\n\nGrace Huang\nEmail: ysh@uchicago.edu\nGitHub: @ysh627\nOffice: Green 208\nOffice hours: Wednesdays 12-1:30pm (email for alternative appointment)\n\n\n\nHubs:\n\nCourse site & syllabus (you are here!)\nPiazza\nCanvas\nExample repo: schelling-games\n\nDuplicate this repo to poke around a (mostly) functional github pages site created entirely using R Markdown. Most of the .Rmd and .R files include extensive commenting, including some ideas for how you can practice coding by revising or adding to those R scripts directly. (I recommend duplicating rather than mirroring. Set up a new repo via “import” using the same url copied from the green code tab. You’ll have a completely different repo – no need to worry about messing up the original. If you just clone it, it will still be attached to the original, but your changes still won’t push because you aren’t a collaborator.)\n\nClass repo: d2m-2024\n\nBegins empty at the start of the quarter. Will be updated with in-class demos and data as we go.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse materials\n\nMost required readings will be drawn from one of the following great (and free! and online!) resources:\n\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham\nR Markdown for Scientists by Nicholas Tierney\nAlso check out R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund\n\nAdditional resources can be found on the resources page\n\n\n\nDataset\nNearly all assignments in this course will involve working with a dataset of your choice. We will begin with setting up a repo for your data and R scripts, then move to tidying the data, then to analyzing and plotting the data, and finally to interpreting the results based on those data. In other words, having an appropriate dataset as early as possible is essential. You will get the most out of this class if you work with your own data for a project you will continue to be invested in after the end of the quarter, like a BA or MA thesis, grant proposal, or manuscript intended for publication. If you are not currently working on this type of project, you should consider taking this class next year (or whenever you do have data). Whether or not you use your own data, you are responsible for providing your dataset. Read the dataset selection guidelines for more information."

    "section": "Grading",
    "text": "Grading\nStudents enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:\n\nShort assignments: 60% (graded complete/incomplete, 3% each)\nScientific report: 20% (including 2 ungraded preparatory tasks)\nParticipation: 20% (including self-assessment)\n\n\nAssignments\nThere is a short assignment for each lecture. Each assignment will involve working with your own data, data provided for that assignment, or both and is designed to give you hands-on practice with using R. Assignments typically begin in class and may be completed after class (each one is highlighted in orange) on a pass/fail basis. Students must push their completed assignment to the appropriate GitHub repository, tagging and Dr. Dowling (@nrdowling) and Grace (@ysh627) with the assignment number so that they receive a notification. There are 20 assignments total, each worth 3% of your final grade.\nAssignment details are included at the end of the lecture slides.\nWhen are the assignments due? We will usually start assignments in class. Anything you don’t finish during class time should be completed before the start of the next class meeting. If an assignment is listed under “pre-class preparation,” it should (hopefully unsurprisingly) be completed in preparation for the start of that class.\nNeed help? We will do much of this work in class, so ask your questions while we’re together. Each student will be assigned to a support group of other students to help answer questions (in addition to access to help from Dr. Dowling and Grace during office hours). A large portion of the course is developing your search skills when it comes to debugging your code (look for advice and solutions from others who have faced similar problems on sites like stackoverflow and github)! Week 2 slides will include a formal procedure to follow for troubleshooting help.\n\n\nScientific report\nYour final assignment will be a scientific report in R Markdown that is developed via a GitHub repository and includes:\n\ndata read-in, pre-processing, and analysis\nat least 2 figures and 1 table with captions and in-text references\nat least 2 in-text R code references\nBibTeX citations\nat least 1500 words of the manuscript in at least four subsections (Introductions, Methods, Results, Discussion; unless otherwise agreed with Dr. Dowling).\n\nAdditional details about report requirements will be provided throughout the quarter.\nItems on the syllabus in green indicate preparatory tasks for your final report: receiving approval for your dataset (by Tuesday of Week 2) and negotiating a manuscript plan (by Friday of Week 7). Each requires you to submit something informal via Canvas. These tasks are not graded, but grading for your final report will be contingent on completing both on time. Failing to meet with me for a report meeting will result in an automatic 10 points off your final report grade.\n\n\nParticipation\nStudents earn participation credit through their attendance and participation in their support group and discussion of course content in office hours. Students are generally expected to come to class prepared to practice using R together. That means you should come with your charged laptop, prepared with any data you are using and any installed software that is required (see the ‘preparation’ note for each class). Be prepared to share your screen with your support group and with the instructors. That said, please stay in touch about your limitations regarding in-person participation and/or technology access.\nThis grade is not an attendance grade. It is much more important that you care for your mental and physical health and the health of those around you than it is to check the “came to class” box. Please do not come to class if you are ill, but DO contact Dr. Dowling and Grace at least 24 hours in advance of an absence, when possible. Missing classes without notifying us may result in a lower participation grade. If your attendance is low enough to impact your work (with or without notifying us) you will need to meet with Dr. Dowling to discuss how it may affect your grade.\n\nSelf-assessment\nAt the end of the quarter you will write a brief reflection (1-2 paragraphs) on your participation in this class and assign yourself a grade (out of 20).\nYour self-assigned grade may or may not end up as your final participation grade, but it will be strongly taken into consideration.\n\n\nGrading\nParticipation grades will be posted to this assignment at the same time your final scientific report is graded. Once assigned, participation grades are final. If you are concerned about your grade you should reach out to Dr. Dowling or Grace before the end of the quarter, who can give you guidance on ways to increase this part of your grade.\n\n\n\nLate work & attendance\nLife happens. Family emergencies, exams for other courses, COVID-19, roommates in crisis…\nIf you need an extension, just ask. Send an email to Dr. Dowling (cc Grace) as far in advance as possible explaining what’s going on (vague!) and how much extra time you need (specific). It is never necessary to provide details about your physical or mental health. You are always welcome to have an open discussion about what you’re dealing with in office hours, but in your emails about absences it is more than sufficient to just say you’re sick or having a personal emergency.\nWith prior notice and instructor approval, late work will not be penalized. Students who register for the class after one or more assignments were already due should contact Dr. Dowling to arrange an extended deadline.\nWithout notice and/or approval, or after the agreed upon extended deadline:\n\nShort assignments will be graded as incomplete, receiving 0 (of 3) points.\nFinal scientific reports will lose 1 (of 20) points per 12 hours late.\n\nIf you will be missing class for any reason, email both Dr. Dowling and Grace before the start of class. Please do not come to class if you are feeling at all ill. You do not need to be specific about why you will be absent, but please do give a guess as to when you’ll be back in class and whether you’ll be able to work remotely while you’re out.\nStressed out by emailing professors? Here are some good examples of what is helpful for your instructors.\n\nI have exams in two other classes 5th week. Is it ok if I take an extra 48 hours to turn in Assignment 5?\n\n\nI just found out I need to quarantine after a COVID exposure. No positive test as of now, so I’ll plan on missing classes Tuesday and Thursday but completing the assignments at home. I’ll let you know if anything changes.\n\n\nI have a family emergency and need to travel home. I won’t be able to work while I’m home and I’m not sure how long I’ll need to be away. Can we meet over Zoom to make a plan to handle late assignments and absences?"

(e.g., ‘child-gesture-study’, NOT ‘thesis’ or ‘d2m’)\n\nInvite @nrdowling (Natalie) and @ysh627 (Grace) as collaborators to your repo\n\nIf you intend to use a private repo with protected data, invite collaborators now, but wait on uploading the data.\nOnce you are assigned to a support group you will also invite your group members as collaborators.\n\nMake 1+ change to the README, commit changes with an informative message, and push to GitHub\nREVERSE a change on GitHub, pull to your local project/repo, and review the changes\nCreate a GitHub issue (not a commit!) with the text:\n\nTitle:\u000bAssignment 1.1\nBody:\u000b@nrdowling @ysh627 I have completed the following:\n[x] I have invited you both as repo collaborators\n[x] I have cloned this repo to create an R Studio Project\n[x] I have made at least 1 commit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (2) Initialize your papaja document\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the tidyverse and papaja packages\nCreate an R script file (.R) that:\n\nLoads the tidyverse and papaja packages\nREQUIRES 1+ other package of your choice\nIncludes 1+ lines of commented text\nAssigns 1+ numeric variable and 1+ string/character variable\nBONUS: Create a dataframe\n\nCreate an R Notebook with the Papaja template\n\nChange the title and author fields at the top\nsource() your R script in the first code chunk\n\nFOR THIS AND ALL GRADED ASSIGNMENTS: Commit (with an informative message) and push to GitHub tagging Dr. Dowling and Grace\nUngraded final step (no submission): knit .Rmd to Word doc or PDF and troubleshoot as needed\nAbove-and-beyond: Experiment with creating .Rmd files without papaja\n\nWe’ll only use papaja in this class, but knowing how to make use of .Rmds with other outputs might be very useful for you. For example if you want to make an html page (like this one!) or produce manuscripts in non-APA styles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPapaja installation (extra info)\n\n\n\n\n\nPapaja installation is trickier than other packages for a few reasons:\n\nIt is not currently available through CRAN and so cannot be installed with the install.packages() function. Papaja is now available through CRAN! Hooray! That means you can install it just like anything else, with the function install.packages(\"papaja\"). These directions for installing it directly from the source will still work, but the CRAN installation should be much simpler.\nIt requires manually setting up a TeX distribution – like TinyTex (recommended), MikTeX, MacTeX, or TeX Live – which can have their own installation issues.\nBecause the installation is a relatively involved process, it can be difficult to determine exactly where in the process errors are occurring.\n\nSo what are you supposed to do about it?\n\nFollow the installation guide in papaja’s detailed documentation. I recommend starting with this guide rather than going to it when you hit a problem. Past students have encountered an issue where once their TeX distribution was installed in an incompatible way, they couldn’t undo it.\nIf it doesn’t install smoothly, set a timer for 1 hour and do your best to troubleshoot the issue. If you can’t fix it in that time, makes notes on what you’ve done so far and what you think might still be going wrong and then stop messing with it.\n\nAdjust your assignment submission as follows:\n\nCreate an .Rmd with the default Notebook template (& update the YAML title field)\nInclude the line of code that would load the papaja package, then comment out that line\nAdd your notes from above about the state of the installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset approval\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the dataset guidelines\nOnce you are confident your dataset meets the requirements, request approval via email by Friday Jan 5 at 11:59pm:\n\nSend the email to Dr. Dowling (ndowling @ uchicago.edu) and cc Grace (ysh @ uchicago.edu)\nSubject line should be: (Your first & last name) Dataset Selection\n\nYour email should include:\n\nA brief (2-4 sentences) description of your data\nThe data itself, in whole or part; this may be an attached .csv file, a link to a shared document, or instructions for where to find the data on the github repo you have already invited us to\n\nIf you are unable to share the data with us via email (due to IRB limitations or anonymization concerns), explain this issue and a tentative plan for how you will get the data into a sharable state (i.e., any data necessary to run your analyses is included in a private github repo) within one week\n\n\nAt least one research question you tentatively plan to ask that can be answered with this dataset in the state it is currently in\n\nSpecifically, your question should be answerable with an outcome variable in your data right now\nIt’s ok if it’s a boring question, and it’s ok if you do not end up answering this question in your final project\n\n\nOnce you receive a reply approving your data from either Dr. Dowling or Grace, complete the Canvas assignment to receive completion credit\n\nDue before class on Tuesday Jan 9th 11am, meaning you will need to have gotten approval over the weekend\nIn the text box, include a brief but descriptive name for your dataset and the sender (Dr. Dowling/Grace) and timestamp of the approval email\n\nNOTE: If you received approval for your dataset when you requested enrollment consent, you do not need to request it again. Simply complete the Canvas assignment to receive credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, January 9 2024 (2.1)\n\nPre-class preparation\nTake the weekend to catch up on any pre-quarter preparation tasks not yet completed. It is critical that you are fully caught up by today or you will not be able to follow along with demos and assignments. Additionally, confirm that your dataset approval is marked as complete on Canvas (contact Dr. Dowling if it is not marked as complete by start of class).\n\n\nClass meeting\nslides\n\nLecture: Best Practices & Troubleshooting\nAssignment: (3) Create and edit your README.md and .gitignore files\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2 / Class 1 Details\n\n\n\n\n\nReadings & resources\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices for programming in R (in D2M)*\nTidyverse style guide\nPapaja documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (3) README.md & .gitignore\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: README\n\nCreate a README.md file in the top level of your repo if it doesn’t exist\nEdit your README to include:\n\nA brief description of your data\nA brief overview of your planned project\nA real or hypothetical file tree\n\nFormat of your choosing\nThis can be extremely simple, but should demonstrate you’ve thought about how plan to keep your repo organized.\n\n\nAt a minimum, your README should include the following markdown elements:\n\n1 header (any level)\nbold italics or strikethough\n\n\nPart 2: .gitignore\n\nCreate a .gitignore file in the top level of your repo if it does not exist\n\nYou can start with GitHub’s default R .gitignore template\n\nEdit the .gitignore to include:\n\nA dedicated directory called localonly\nAll files of specific types that you want on your computer but don’t want to upload to GitHub\nOne specific file that is not in an ignored folder and is not an ignored filetype\n\nAdd a comment for each\n\n\nNOTE: A primary goal of this assignment is for you to practice answering your own questions. We have not formally covered either of these files in detail. It’s you job to figure out the point and the implementation of each. There will be a slide in the W2C2 lecture with “verbose” instructions for the .gitignore.

What data types will your variables need to be? - Does anything that currently looks like string, numeric, or logical data need to be handled as factor?\n\nMockup a preliminary dataset & begin prep - PUSH TO YOUR REPO:\n\nA tabular mock-up of your ideal data structure. Create this in Excel (or similar) either by manipulating your actual data manually or creating fully mock data\n\nYou can do this in R if you want, but the goal is more to get a solid concept of data structure rather than actually executing the data wrangling\n\nBuilding on or replacing the code you wrote in assignment (6), create an .R script called data-prep.R:\n\nUse comments to write out in plain English the prep steps you expect to carry out in order to make your existing data look like your mock-up, including data import, wrangling, and exporting intermediate datasets\nMake note of anything that you know you’ll need to do conceptually but don’t yet know how to execute in R\nBegin to fill in the parts of your data prep you feel comfortable starting, e.g., import/export, filtering/selecting, object assignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, January 23 2024 (4.1)\n\nPre-class preparation\n\nNo new material this week!

Please sign up for regular office hours outside these appointments if you’d like more hands-on support for your project.\nNote that this appointment schedule includes literally all my availability. Do not delay booking an appointment, as I will not be able to accommodate requests to meet outside these times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (8) Recreate this dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreate the modified starwars dataset:\n\nCopy the file starwars.R in the d2m-2024 repo into your own project repo\nFollow the instructions in the file to import and examine the “goal” tibble\nManipulate the built-in starwars tibble to create a new object called sw.wrangled\n\nWhen you type sw.wrangled into the console, you should see exactly what’s in the image: d2m-2024/images/starwars-goal.png\nDon’t forget to check number of rows and column data types\n\nIf you can’t figure everything out, add comments explaining what you would like to do but aren’t sure how\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue prepping (ungraded)\n\n\n\n\nContinue prepping your data! We will finish data wrangling on Thursday. Your data should be fully prepped and ready for analysis and visualization in the tidyverse by Week 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday, January 25 2024 (4.2)\n\nPre-class preparation\n\nNo new material! Aside from a brief discussion about final projects, the whole class will be time to work on data preparation with support from your group and instructors. Review and adjust your plans from assignment (7) ahead of time to make the best use of your time.\n\n\n\nClass meeting\n\n\nBrief discussion of final report requirements\nLab: Data Manipulation in the Tidyverse\nAssignments:\n\n(9) Finish prepping your data!\n\nBefore your final commit, be sure that your scripts include sufficient and informative comments\n\n(10) Imagine two plots you would like to see of your data. Add comment blocks into your rmd describing (in plain English, not code) what elements will be necessary to create each plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4 / Class 2 Details\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (9) Finish prepping your data\n\n\n\n\nFinish preparing your data for analysis and presentation! Use tidyverse tools to create the mock-up data you created in Assignment (7). Be sure your data frames(s) is/are in a tidy, long format. In particular, as you imagine plots you’d like to create in Assignment (10), be sure that any measures you want to include on x or y axes are each in one column and that any groups you might want to compare against each other are in one column\ne.g.: You want to compare number of gestures used by parents and children. Your original wide, untidy dataset includes 2 measurement columns: parent_gestures and child_gestures. Your long, tidy has one speaker column with values parent and child and one n_gestures column with the number of gestures produced by that subject at the observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (10) Mock up 2 plots\n\n\n\n\n\nMock up 2 plots (of 2 different types) you could include in your final report\n\nAdd code chunks to your .Rmd for each plot and give each a unique, informative name\nAdd plain-English comments within your chunks explaining the goal for the plot. To start thinking about this, ask yourself questions like:\n\nWhat variables are on the axis/axes?\nWhat kind of plot is it?\nWill you need to compare across groups?\nWhat would you anticipate seeing if your hypotheses were borne out in your analyses?\n\n\nCreate a visual of each mock-up that render in your .Rmd when you knit. This can be either:\n\nA first attempt at the ggplot code itself if you are already familiar with ggplot\n.jpg/.gif/.png files created outside R (e.g., in Excel, in MS paint, sketched by hand or on an iPad) and called in the text below the corresponding code chunk using R markdown\n\nLook back at the slides or the R Markdown cheatsheet if you don’t remember how to insert an image file!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanvas submission for (post-1-on-1-meeting) final report plan\n\n\n\n\n\nDue by 5pm Friday Week 7: Feb 16, 2024\nAfter your report plan meeting with Dr. Dowling, write up a brief summary of what you discussed and submit to the “Report plan” assignment on Canvas. Your write-up should include:\n\nThe specific plans for you analysis, figure, and table chunks\nA general description for how you will distribute the 1500+ words across 4 sections\nAt least 2 elements of code produced in code chunks that you can referent in text (e.g., a p-value from the model you run in your analysis chunk, a value within the table you created in the table chunk, a summary value like mean or median that you calculated and stored as a variable)\n2-4 sentences explaining your personal goals for the final report. What do you want to have accomplished or learned by the time you submit your report at the end of the quarter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 3: Presentating Data\n\nTuesday, January 30 2024 (5.1)\n\nPre-class preparation\n\nRemember to book your final report meeting with Dr. Dowling and submit the meeting summary to Canvas (see details in W4C2 box above)\nRead chapters on data visualization and ggplot in r4ds: 1* and 9, 10, 11*\nReview the ggplot2 cheatsheet\n\n\n\nClass meeting\nslides\n\nWalkthrough of Assignment (8) Recreate this dataset\n\nFollow along with script in d2m-2024 repo\n\nLecture: Introduction to Data Visualization and ggplot2\nAssignment: (11) Create basic plots (2 parts: recreate these plots & add 1 plot to .Rmd)\n\nsubmit BOTH to receive credit for Assignment (11)!

Commit your final submission of both at the same time in just one commit\nPart 2: Tune up your plot and add another to your .Rmd\n\nTune up the plot you made in Assignment (11), for example think about:\n\nDid you use the best kind of plot to tell the story you’re hoping to tell?\nDid you have to do some wonky wrangling to plot what you wanted?\nAre there adjustments you could make to scale, coord, or labs layers that would make things easier to read?\nAre you effectively making use of groups? Could you communicate your point better by grouping in a different way (e.g., color, shape, fill, facet)? Add code to one chunk created in Assignment (10)\nAdd/edit comments to make note of what you want to do to make your plot “pretty” like customizing colors or fonts, tweaking the theme, or relabeling in the legend\n\nAdd in the second plot you planned in Assignment (10). At a minimum, replicate what you did in Assignment (11) for the first plot. Add some “tune-ups” if you can!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, February 6 2024 (6.1)\n\nPre-class preparation\n\nRefer to the ggplot2 resources from last week\nRead up on ggplot theme layer customization in the documentation and ggplot2-book\n\nThese are going to be essential references when you do Assignment (13)!\n\nIf you haven’t signed up for a report meeting, do that right now. Slots are filling up fast, and report meeting slots during week 7 are competing with MAPSS pre-registration meeting slots. I cannot meet outside the listed appointment times. Failing to meet with me for a report meeting will result in an automatic 10 points off your final report grade.\n\n\n\nClass meeting\nslides\n\nLecture: “Pretty Plots” & .Rmd Figure Chunks\nAssignment: (13) Create advanced plots (2 parts: recreate this hideous plot & tune up your own plots\n\nsubmit BOTH to receive credit for Assignment (13)!

Commit your final submission of both at the same time in just one commit\nPart 1: Recreate this plot\n\nIn your existing starwars.R file from Assignments (8), (11), & (12), replicate this using dplyr and ggplot2 functions (these can be found in the d2m-2024 repo)\n\nPlot 1\n\nYou do not need to save this as an image file\nIf plotting the dataset you created in Assignment (8) isn’t working as expected, reproduce it with the code provided during the class walkthrough\nThere’s a lot going on visually in this plot. Start by creating a base plot with just the required aes() mappings and geoms, then making a commented list of all the different modifications you can spot, whether or not you have any idea how to replicate them. Some hints:\n\nYou’ll need 13 elements in your theme() layer after setting one of the built-in themes\nInstall, load, and investigate the ggsci package to choose a scale layer\nLook for a list of “web-safe font families” to find the right fonts\nNeither the limits nor breaks arguments are required in your axis scales\nRemember that facet text can’t be modified in the labs() layer\nYou can use a color selector (i.e., eye-dropper) tool like this one to identify precise colors\n\nIf something doesn’t look right even with the precise hex code, it could be an effect of transparency (“alpha”) somewhere along the way\n\n\nTry to match as much as you can, but don’t let it drive you crazy. Set a timer to keep working, then add/edit comments to describe what is still left to be done. Your completion grade is going to be based on putting in a good-faith effort, not getting a perfect replication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (13) Part 2: Tune up your plots & .Rmd code chunks\n\n\n\n\n\nsubmit BOTH tasks to receive credit for Assignment (13)!

Be sure that when you knit the document you see the figures numbered in the order you expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, February 13 2024 (7.1)\n\nPre-class preparation\n\n(15) Imagine (at least) two analyses you would like to run with your data, including 1+ descriptive analysis and 1+ hypothesis testing analysis. Add comment blocks into your rmd describing (in plain English, not code) the analyses you intend to run, for example listing the independent and dependent variables, explaining your hypothesized results, and identifying precisely which tests are appropriate.\n\nThis is a good place to check in with your co-authors or advisor before moving forward!\n\nREMINDER: You must meet with Dr. Dowling by the end of this week (i.e., before end of day Friday, February 16th) to negotiate your plan for the scientific report assignment, which is due on Tuesday of Finals Week.\n\nDon’t delay! More than 25 of these meetings need to happen; don’t count on available meeting times at the end of 7th week. You can sign up for office hours any time in weeks 5-7 to make your report plan. Extra slots will be added to my office hours sign-up schedule for these weeks. Look out for a Canvas announcement sometime in week 3 or 4 for when those times are posted.\nFailing to meet with me for a report meeting will result in an automatic 10 points off your final report grade.\n\n\n\n\nClass meeting\n\nNo slides this week!

Anything that starts with r is what I mean here.\nRemember that just using backticks without the r is just formatting, not code. (Everything on this page that looks like code in monospaced font is done that way.)\n\nAt least 1 of these in-line code refs should “do something.” In other words, it should be more than just a value reference; it should include a function.\n\nExamples of value calls:\n\n`r knitr::inline_expr(\"model$p.value\")`\n`r knitr::inline_expr(\"median_mpg\")`\n`r knitr::inline_expr('mass_height_corr3$ci2[[\"r\"]]')`\n\nExamples of in-line function code:\n\n`r knitr::inline_expr(\"apa_p(model$p.value)\")`\n`r knitr::inline_expr(\"nrow(filter(mtcars, mpg &gt; median(mpg)))\")`\n`r knitr::inline_expr('round(mass_height_corr3$ci2[[\"r\"]], 3)')`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule 4: Creating a Manuscript\n\nTuesday, February 20 2024 (8.1)\n\nPre-class preparation\n\nReview the readings & references box below to get a head start installing Zotero, Better BibTeX, and the citr package.\nPull the most recent version of the d2m-2024 repo and browse the bibtex-demo directory.\n\n\n\nClass meeting\nslides\n\nLecture: BibTeX References, citr, & Zotero\nWorkshop: Set up your ideal citation enviornment and start citing\nAssignment: (18) Create a .bib file with 5+ references\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8 / Class 1 Details\n\n\n\n\n\nReadings & resources\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloads:\n\nZotero citation manager\ncitr R package/add-on\n\nNote: current version cannot be installed with CRAN, follow their instructions to install from GitHub\n\nBetter BibTeX Zotero extension/add-on\n\nReference:\n\nCitations in papaja\nR Mardown & BibTeX\nReproducible Research in R Ch10: Citations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment (18) Create a .bib file and add 5+ in-text BibTeX citations\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish downloading and setting up Zotero, Better BibTeX, and the citr package add-on\nCreate a .bib file\n\nSince you’ve been working in a papaja document all quarter, it’s likely a .bib file was automatically generated or that you made a blank one so that your .Rmd would knit properly. If so, you can continue to use that one or create a new one, just make sure it is named appropriately and referenced correctly in the .Rmd where needed\nUse the papaja default (r-references.bib) or give it some other sensible name\n\nAdd 5+ relevant references for your manuscript\n\nTry to do different entry types if you can (journal article, book, book chapter, conference paper, etc.)\nAlready wrote a lit review for your project/proposal? Great! You don’t need to rewrite it. You can copy and paste your existing work into your RMarkdown notebook, edit formatting as needed, and then swap out the in-text citations you wrote out manually for dynamic bibtex references\n\nKnit your .Rmd to .pdf and confirm that the citations render as expected\n\nError messages? Add/edit/check the name of your .bib file in the YAML header\nUnexpected formatting?\n\nCheck your .bib file to see if the problem is in that file (in which case, correct it)\nIf not, debug by pinpointing the problem and following the troubleshooting guidelines from W2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday, February 22 2024 (8.2)\n\nPre-class preparation\nCome to class with all your BibTeX tools from last class installed and fully functional!

    "text": "Thomas Schelling introduced the concept of “focal points” in The Strategy of Conflict with the intention of expanding the contemporary perspectives of game theory to include cooperative, not just competitive, games in human decision making (Schelling, 1960). Though his work certainly proved influential in this regard, concepts of focal points and coordination games have found relevance well beyond game theory and economics as a whole. From improvisational music (Canonne, 2018) to urban planning (Rondinelli, 1983), from human-computer interfacing (Wong et al., 2009) to linguistic anthropology (Brown & Levinson, 1987), from social stereotyping (Yoon & Hollingshead, 2010) to online gaming (Ross & Collister, 2014), elements of Schelling’s framework of coordinated decision-making seem ubiquitous.\nWe constructed a survey modeled after Schelling’s original report. Schelling himself did not perform a true “study” in reporting his results, but rather loosely surveyed the graduate students in his class at Yale in the 1950s (precise year unclear). Our data collection was similarly gathered quite loosely. The survey data were collected with the intention of serving a pedagogical purpose and with no intention to be published as rigorous study. While we cannot use these data to make empirical claims, they are nonetheless a useful and thought-provoking educational tool (as Schelling’s data certainly were).\n\n\nThis page reports responses from all MA students since 2023.\nYou can also view responses from:\n\nAll participants\nAll MAPSS students (since 2023)\n\n\n\n\nResponses have been cleaned to account for predictable variations in how individuals input popular responses – e.g., “the reg”, “Regenstein”, and “In the Reg.” are all reported as “The Reg.” Ambiguous responses (e.g., “the library”) are left ambiguous. Responses that indicated clear misunderstanding of the question are excluded1 and some responses were coded as “Other” when necessary.2"

    "title": "Teaching Statements",
    "section": "Teaching Philosophy",
    "text": "Teaching Philosophy\nMy teaching philosophy is driven by the belief that learning is a collaborative and interactive process. My research revolves around the remarkable role of interaction in language learning, and I see this mirrored in the classrooms of the most impactful and inspiring teachers I have known. These teachers emphasized three essential pieces of any culture of learning: learning how to learn, approaching information openly and critically, and making connections to integrate knowledge. I bring these same priorities to my teaching approach.\n\nLearning how to learn\nI believe both lecture and seminar classes can be shaped into interactive opportunities for students to put general reasoning skills into practice, so that learning develops as an active skill. I create a low-stakes environment where students are emboldened to share their “hot takes” and speak up when things don’t make sense. I encourage admission of ignorance as a chance to learn something new, and maintain a conversational tone where students, in their words, “never feel dumb.” It is my responsibility as an instructor to embody the attitudes I wish to promote, which means allowing my own ignorance to serve as a learning opportunity. For instance, when leading a discussion for Introduction to Human Development, I was unable to answer a student’s questions about experimental protocols for non-human primate studies. We talked about the scope of research domains and how I might go about finding an answer to something far from my area of expertise. As a class, we turned fuzzy ideas into two specific questions and went through the process of accessing library resources to find answers.\nCentering my classes around discussion when possible allows me to quickly identify and address students’ knowledge gaps. In the same introductory class, I noticed students mixing up anthropological and psychological approaches. I opened the floor to general questions about social science disciplines and learned that many students had never been explicitly taught several foundational concepts. For the next class I prepared a thirty-minute methods crash course with a brief lecture and group activity. One of the most meaningful moments in my time as an instructor happened two years later, when a graduating senior told me this crash course was the deciding factor for sticking with the major. I am proud that I was able to recognize missing pieces and make a lasting impact beyond my classroom for at least one student.\n\n\nCritically approaching materials and concepts\nWith the goal of developing analytic reasoning, I stress to my students that being critical is not the same as being dismissive. My students should feel empowered to find weak points in the arguments they encounter but also work to find value in ideas they disagree with. For instance, in a lesson about WEIRD bias in psychology, I randomly assigned students to argue for one of two polarized views on the topic in a loosely structured and lighthearted debate. After some creative work to defend extreme positions they would not typically endorse, they came together in a large group discussion to reflect on nuances of the issue they had not previously considered and to collectively form a more balanced position on the matter.\nWhen teaching the psychology of language, I ask students to reflect on their own language usage, positioning them as experts of their own experience. Students are eager to engage with course materials when they can imagine how it is directly reflected (or not!) in their own lives. Rather than brushing aside personal anecdotes as irrelevant to academic inquiry, I allow students to see their experience with language as a valuable tool for brainstorming, interrogating, and investing in a topic. Individual and shared experiences act as touchstones for delving into empirical work on course concepts, and written assignments allow students to practice differentiating objective and subjective evidence. Students learn to discern which kinds of evidence are appropriate in different forms of academic writing and oral presentation.\n\n\nMaking connections and integrating knowledge\nI aim to create opportunities for marginalized voices to be heard – quite literally – as not only welcome but indispensable in classroom discussions. By letting students make meaningful contributions to discussion through their own language expertise, I stress the importance of language diversity both academically and as a classroom community. Many contexts on a college campus implicitly or explicitly promote the use of a Mainstream American English academic register, muffling the voices of students who have been told their English is incorrect or found lacking. Individuals vulnerable to this kind of silencing are integral members of any complete discussion about language and interaction. As an instructor it is my responsibility to create opportunities for students to present their perspectives as necessary data for understanding the psychology of language. By underscoring the value of diverse language experience in the formal study of language, I can encourage contributions about interaction via multiple languages, dialects, and registers from students who identify with these experiences. These diverse voices are essential both for our theoretical understanding of interaction and for an inclusive classroom that fosters welcoming and productive discussion.\nRecognizing individual differences in learning styles promotes student ownership of both classwork and their education more generally. One of the most common frustrations I have heard from students is feeling overwhelmed with pressure to bring “original ideas” into written assignments. In response, I highlight the value of a comparative approach to their coursework and tailor supports to individual students. For example, I offer students multiple strategies to go beyond a compare-and-contrast summary style paper, allowing comparative exercises to generate elusive original ideas. For students who struggle with rigidity, I ask them to imagine Piaget and Vygotsky getting a drink together at the end of a long day. What are they laughing about? What are they fighting about? Does the barkeeper have any words of wisdom? For students who learn more effectively with a structured exercise, I help them create a visual representation of the basic comparative framework they are familiar with as a first step toward a deeper analysis. I ask questions grounded in this visual representation to help students push farther. Where are the gaps and blank spots in the diagram? What overlap surprises you?\n\n\nAssessment and evaluation\nI prefer to evaluate student progress in two pieces. First, weekly iterative assignments provide students with ongoing opportunities to develop their critical thinking and writing skills. Frequent feedback allows for incremental improvement in a low-stakes assessment, and progressive assignments allow me to monitor understanding and growth, intervening as needed. With occasional longer written assignments, I can assess broader learning objectives like drawing connections across multiple theories, discriminating among texts, and producing cohesive written arguments. This assessment style is also advantageous for classes on methodology, where students can recognize and correct misconceptions with each step of a systematic concept, avoiding a domino effect of misunderstanding.\nWith any assessment, I believe students deserve evaluation that is transparent, consistent, and sufficient. It is important to me that my students recognize evaluation is never a punishment or personal judgment, but rather a tool they can leverage for their own benefit. I provide assignment rubrics outlining my expectations, providing structure for written feedback and modeling how students can improve future work. When possible, I enact standards- and specification-based grading. I believe incorporating these alternative grading schemes into my syllabus holds me accountable to myself and my students in assigning grades fairly, ensures consistency among teams of graders, and allows students to take ownership of their work.\nAs I emphasize in my classroom, I believe the ability to recognize one’s shortcomings, mistakes, and ignorance is one of the most important and admirable abilities a scholar can learn. I stress that it is a skill to develop rather than a personality trait and confess that I have gone through the painful process of choosing to be vulnerable to criticism. I try to embody this message as a teacher by both modeling how to admit to and learn from mistakes and by actively soliciting student feedback about their learning and my teaching. Since incorporating regular and anonymous requests for student feedback, I have been able to adapt my classes to meet the needs of each particular group. I am grateful for students’ comments on both my syllabus and my teaching style, allowing me to design more effective lessons and to reflect on how I can do a better job promoting the diverse, inclusive, and supportive community I strive for.\nMy philosophy on teaching is motivated by the kind of teacher I always admired and aspire to be: flexible, inquisitive, and approachable. It is my hope that these practices reinforce a culture of trust and accountability, enabling my students to develop a sense of ownership of their education they may carry with them going forward."

    "section": "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion",
    "text": "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nScholarship in the social sciences is inherently related to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Researchers who make claims about how the mind works must recognize how our work is predicated on systems of marginalization and perpetuates existing inequity. It is my responsibility to promote representation and accessibility in the design and dissemination of my research and in my contact with students.\n\nEquity in research practices\nI work to be vigilantly mindful of my privilege and the inequities I risk tacitly endorsing in my research. I employ strategies like increasing the accessibility of presented materials with tools like written access papers and captions and representing a diverse range of racial, ethnic, dis/ability, and gender identities in presentation of my work. For example, I recognized that while the families in the parent-child interaction corpus I work with are representative of the racial diversity of Chicago, an overwhelming majority of the project’s “go-to videos” for presentations have historically featured white families. This discrepancy was especially great for examples of language use leading to positive outcomes, implicitly reinforcing the racist and untrue perception that Black children learn “incorrect” English in the home. I work together with several colleagues to maintain a shared collection of video clips reflecting the diversity of our families that researchers may draw from when disseminating our work.\nI use my work to create avenues for students who are passionate about social justice to pursue their own research questions. For example, a recent mentee used my work as a foundation for her undergraduate honors thesis exploring pragmatic development in children with early brain injury. Another mentee was interested in how parents and adults can best support autistic children with language delays. Though no one at our institution was conducting research exactly in line with her questions, she persisted. We worked together to design and execute a thesis project giving her a background in nonverbal communication and early pragmatic development, allowing her to pursue her initial research questions in a Ph.D. program. I intend to use my resources as a faculty member to continue supporting undergraduates’ interests in these areas.\n\n\nAccessibility in the classroom\nI acknowledge that I have so far had limited ability to effect social change through my research. Most of my efforts to enacting practices of diversity, equity, and inclusion have taken place in the classroom. I design my classes to create an infrastructure of accessibility. I do not use one concrete set of classroom policies for all classes, and instead allow the learning objectives and course design to inform policies around late assignments, attendance, etc. Though there may be variation from course to course, each class’s syllabus presents its policies unambiguously. Additionally, the syllabus should clearly indicate avenues for students to request exceptions and accommodations; policies must not only be appropriate for the course, but for individual students as agents of their education.\nI have been fortunate to teach and mentor students with highly diverse identities, backgrounds, and academic interests, helping me develop the ability to identify students struggling due to factors of marginalization. I have seen that a poorly written essay rarely indicates a student’s engagement with the material, overall efforts, or capacity for academic writing. More often it indicates the student is a non-native speaker of Mainstream American English, has graduated from an under-resourced school system, has a learning disability, or has been otherwise limited in opportunities for learning and practicing foundational writing skills.\nI am committed to providing student-guided support. I must respect that my privilege will remain a barrier to understanding the lived experiences of my students. Although I continue to educate myself on how to best engage with diverse groups of students through DEI programming, I have seen that true diversity of individual identities means a true diversity of needs. I do not subscribe to a one-size-fits-all approach to accommodation. With respect to the example above, a student with dyslexia and a late-learner of English may have similar difficulties with grammatical errors but benefit from entirely different support structures. I firmly believe my students will always have the best understanding of their unique circumstances and needs.\n\n\nAgency and accountability in the classroom\nI aim to create a welcoming and inclusive space for all students. I have seen that even simple practices like addressing students by name, sharing preferred pronouns, and creating opportunities for students to speak directly with one another can show students they are valued and have a positive impact on classroom climate. I am grateful to the many psychologists, linguists, and others who maintain and contribute to shared databases of work from BIPOC authors, providing an invaluable resource for diversifying instructional materials. I work alongside my students to build an inclusive community, giving students concrete tools they can use to actively participate, like using “step up, step back” discussion guidelines, encouraging both calling out and calling in, and offering specific strategies for actively listening and contributing to discussion and offering firm, respectful disagreement.\nMy role as preceptor for BA Honors students in Comparative Human Development illuminated a significant issue around students’ agency I had not previously considered. My students were passionate about social justice and eager to tackle research problems of diversity and equity. Yet there was a paradoxical barrier I had not anticipated. Students from marginalized groups wanted to do work with a direct impact on their own communities but worried their contributions would be dismissed for lacking an objective perspective. Meanwhile, students from highly privileged backgrounds felt they lacked the right to pursue research questions about identities they did not share and communities they did not belong to. From my vantage point, it was clear that these two concerns together put everyone in a position of being too objective or too subjective, leaving no one “allowed” to do this work. I encouraged students to explore where these beliefs came from. Unsurprisingly, the most effective way of helping students understand the value of their individual perspectives was to embrace the diversity of the group, facilitating an open discussion of these topics among the students. We saw some fears dispelled, other concerns validated. In the end, some students felt emboldened to pursue their interests. Other students continued to hold reservations and so adapted their research questions or methods based on the community’s feedback. This remained an ongoing and thought-provoking discussion throughout the year, as useful for me as for my students. I am committed to continuing this conversation in my future work with undergraduates and colleagues alike.\nWhen a classroom is truly inclusive, marginalized voices are essential for achieving the aims of the course. I include the relationships between language and marginalization as an active part of my Conversation in Context syllabus, where units are designed to get students talking about the social and interactive consequences of language. For many students my classes may be the first time they have reflected on the languages they speak as factors defining their identities, reinforcing privilege and marginalization, and subconsciously influencing their own social judgments. Students may arrive fully prepared to relate familiar sources of bias to language, such as discussing how the enforcement of Standard/Mainstream American English in schools disadvantages Black students who speak African American [Vernacular] English in the home. I can use these foundational ideas to push students further, examining how this terminology contributes to normalization and othering as it pits “Standard American” against “African American,” offering an opportunity to reflect on who does and who does not have the privilege of being unmarked in society. From there, I can draw students’ attention to how speech and language can contribute to additional forms systematic othering, like the ageism and sexism surrounding upspeak and creaky voice or the ableism of disability interventions that prioritize speech over other kinds of communication. Students’ identities are not incidental as the class works through these challenging topics, they are integral.\nI recognize that I still have much to learn from my students, colleagues, and communities in the way of actively promoting antiracist and inclusive scholarship. As a white, educated, cisgender woman, I must first and foremost commit to listen. I attempt to be gracious when faced with criticism and actively seek feedback for how to improve representation and accessibility in my work. “Inclusive instructor and researcher” is not a box for me to check off, it is – and will always be – a continuous and conscientious choice I must make."

After an introduction during orientation week, we devote 6 weeks of this course to learning 6 influential theories and approaches (in our words, “perspectives”) that social scientists use to understand the nature of social life and individual behavior. While the course does not provide a comprehensive overview of all perspectives in the social sciences, it is designed to stimulate thought about how standards of argumentation and evidence are applied in social science research. We read classic and contemporary social science research and discuss the perspective in seminar sessions, teaching how to “reverse engineer” texts to identify and analyze the authors’ theoretical and methodological choices. Developing these skills is critical to success in graduate courses and the M.A. research thesis. Our study of these 6 perspectives is intended to familiarize students with a broad range of ways that scholars study social life, an essential part of graduate education in the social sciences. The other three weeks of this course, interspersed throughout the quarter, are devoted to M.A. thesis preparation. Here students apply developing knowledge of social science research to begin formulating a thesis project.

By the time American English-speaking children begin school, they have used conversational interaction to master many of the fundamentals of their language. They are not, however, masters of conversational interaction.\nBecause language is much more than just speech, my work approaches language development as fundamentally multimodal, examining the changing functions of co-speech gestures as children become collaborative conversationalists. Why and when do children use gestures before words? What kinds of nonverbal messages are children sending when they speak? As adults, do we notice?\nAs faculty in the Master of Arts Program in the Social Sciences and a graduate of the Department of Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago, I share a commitment to an interdisciplinary research approach to the study of communicative development. Using a longitudinal corpus of spontaneous parent-child interaction, my work combines elements of conversation analysis with formal speech and gesture coding to investigate how the tools of cooperative conversation change over development.\nMy research explores the acquisition and integration of linguistic and non-linguistic elements of discourse-pragmatics from infancy to adulthood.

These assessments are designed to be quickly and easily administered by early childhood educators in the classroom while serving as highly statistically reliable measures for longitudinal learning achievement. In addition to developing this series of assessments, GoT provides educators with clear and continuous feedback to recognize skill-level milestones and support each student throughout the school year. GoT additionally provides classroom instructional materials to help teachers scaffold student learning in tandem with the assessment.\nI was actively involved in the development of the Oral Language and Literacy (OLL) assessment and instructional materials from 2017-2021. Serving as an IES Pre-Doctoral Fellow on the project, I developed crosswalks from the GoT assessment to commonly used pre-K curricula. While it became clear from these crosswalks and teacher feedback that pre-K educators felt comfortable supporting students in early literacy skills, this was not the case for oral language skills. A unique feature of the Getting on Track assessments is the evidence-based emphasis on promoting oral language development in addition to literacy, such morphological production, syntactic comprehension, and concept formation. My primary role on this project has been to strategically fill in those gaps: 1) revising assessment items and administration design, 2) drafting plain-English explanations for teachers for how and why we assess these unfamiliar skills as well as benchmarks and stage-based learning objectives, 3) creating lesson plans for instructional activities to offer educators concrete methods for incorporating oral language learning into their classrooms.\nPrincipal investigators and project leadership: Alana Dulaney, PhD; Susan Goldin-Meadow, PhD; Marc Hernandez, PhD; Debbie Leslie, MAT; Susan C Levine, PhD; Stephen Raudenbush, EdD; Janet Sorkin, PhD\nLearn more about Getting on Track from NORC"

    "text": "Pragmatic Gestures\n\n\nfrom Infancy to Adolescence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren begin using pragmatic co-speech gestures at the earliest stages of language development. Well before toddlers create their first two-words utterances, they use conventionalized gestures like shoulder shrugs, wrist flips, and head nods and shakes to communicate epistemic and affective states. Soon after they use these same movements as “beats” to complement prosody and emphasize words. Eventually, they will use these gestures with a high degree of flexibility in both form and function: a twitch of one shoulder and a tilt of the head to express disinterest, a palm up and extended toward their listener to pass the turn, a series of small nods to indicate comprehension through backchannel feedback.\nAlthough children seem to have near mastery of many aspects of their native language before they even begin formal schooling, we know the developmental trajectory of pragmatics extends well into adolescence. We use data from the Language Development Project’s corpus of spontaneous, parent-child interaction in early childhood to explore how co-speech gestures fit into the emergence of these skills.

    "text": "Pragmatic Gestures\n\n\nfrom Infancy to Adolescence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren begin using pragmatic co-speech gestures at the earliest stages of language development. Well before toddlers create their first two-words utterances, they use conventionalized gestures like shoulder shrugs, wrist flips, and head nods and shakes to communicate epistemic and affective states. Soon after they use these same movements as “beats” to complement prosody and emphasize words. Eventually, they will use these gestures with a high degree of flexibility in both form and function: a twitch of one shoulder and a tilt of the head to express disinterest, a palm up and extended toward their listener to pass the turn, a series of small nods to indicate comprehension through backchannel feedback.\nAlthough children seem to have near mastery of many aspects of their native language before they even begin formal schooling, we know the developmental trajectory of pragmatics extends well into adolescence. We use data from the Language Development Project’s corpus of spontaneous, parent-child interaction in early childhood to explore how co-speech gestures fit into the emergence of these skills. In my dissertation research, I ask how these gestures continue to develop into the middle school years in our corpus of parent-child cooperative tasks.\n\n\n\nPublications & Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\nVilà‐Giménez, I., Dowling, N., Demir‐Lira, Ö.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Thomas Schelling introduced the concept of “focal points” in The Strategy of Conflict with the intention of expanding the contemporary perspectives of game theory to include cooperative, not just competitive, games in human decision making (Schelling, 1960). Though his work certainly proved influential in this regard, concepts of focal points and coordination games have found relevance well beyond game theory and economics as a whole. From improvisational music (Canonne, 2018) to urban planning (Rondinelli, 1983), from human-computer interfacing (Wong et al., 2009) to linguistic anthropology (Brown & Levinson, 1987), from social stereotyping (Yoon & Hollingshead, 2010) to online gaming (Ross & Collister, 2014), elements of Schelling’s framework of coordinated decision-making seem ubiquitous.\nIn this brief report, we consider focal points from a cognitive science perspective. We present data from an informal survey mimicking Schelling’s early (and also quite informal) study in The Strategy of Conflict (Schelling, 1960). We discuss our findings as they relate to nonverbal communication and how these concepts may be extended to further our understanding of coordination in everyday conversation.\nFocal points (also called Schelling points) were first conceptualized within the field of economics. Schelling noted that by focusing on zero-sum or fully competitive behavioral scenarios, game theory had failed to account for many real-world games whose outcome rested on successful coordination, not competition, among multiple players (Schelling, 1960). In the context of coordination games, Schelling’s focal points are the salient solutions that players tend to choose due to their intuitively recognizable or, more often, socially shared nature (Schelling, 1960). Critically, players tasked with coordination choose these options even in the absence of explicit communication (Mehta, Starmer, & Sugden, 1994).\nSince being introduced in game theory, focal points have seen broader application across the social sciences. In social psychology, focal points offer an explanation for the natural solutions individuals find in social coordination problems where multiple choices are equally valid, as individuals may rely on common expectations or cultural cues to make decisions that lead to successful coordination (Sugden, 1995). Social norms, traditions, and conventions contribute to the emergence of focal points, and they showcase how individuals rely on shared understanding to achieve coordination without explicit negotiation (Bacharach & Bernasconi, 1997). This concept sheds light on the intricate ways in which human behavior and decision-making are influenced by social context and the desire to align with others (Chwe, 2001).\nThese principles of implicit coordination are clearly applicable to relatively broad real-life contexts, such as meeting someone in a crowded place, deciding on a meeting time without prior communication, or determining where to sit in an auditorium (Schelling, 1960). However, they may additionally apply to narrower contexts we might typically associate with explicit coordination, such as face-to-face conversation. In conversation, we use speech (or sign language) to express meaning “on-the-record,” but conversational interaction consists of much more than formal language (Clark, 1996). “Off-the-record” non-linguistic signals allow interlocutors to send highly informative but implicit messages alongside explicit meaning in speech (Clark, 1996). Nonverbal resources like co-speech gesture and paralinguistic resources like intonation can serve critical pragmatic functions (McNeill, 1992). These tools can make conversation more efficient by allowing addressees to make inferences about speaker intention and meaning based on contextual cues (Clark, 1996).\nIn the context of everyday interaction, the significance of focal points is tightly linked to common ground (Clark, 1996). In simplest terms, conversational common ground is the shared knowledge, beliefs, assumptions, and experiences that participants in a face-to-face conversation believe to be mutually understood (Clark, 1996). At one level, common ground refers to common knowledge (Stalnaker, 1978). If all interlocutors know that they have all been invited to Anna’s birthday party next Saturday, they may discuss the presents they plan to bring without explicitly mentioning who Anna is, why they would be giving her presents, or the deadline for buying a present for the party (Clark & Marshall, 1981). These assumptions are localized to this group in this conversation on this topic, but there are also generalized social assumptions at play (Clark, 1996). The party-goers know that presents are given for birthdays, that both the invitees and the host will be at the party, that the presents will be given to the host at the party, that presents should be appropriate for what the host would want to receive, etc. (Clark & Marshall, 1981).\nConversational common ground also encompasses emergent properties of the interaction, guided by cultural expectations and linguistic systems (Clark, 1996). The party-goers may refer to Anna as the “birthday girl” or simply “her” rather than naming her at each reference (Clark, 1996). One interlocutor may ask a question and expect to get an answer that is prompt, relevant, and truthful, given that all interlocutors are assumed to follow principles of English pragmatics and conversational organization (Grice, 1975). Common ground, both that which is present at the initiation of the conversation and that which emerges as a product of conversation, allows interlocutors to disambiguate and infer meaning with focal points (Clark, 1996). When a party-goer says, “I really hope she likes it,” the listeners face multiple valid options when determining the referents of “she” and “it” (Clark, 1996). The conversation’s general focus on Anna’s birthday likely enables a convergence of understanding on “Anna” as the “she”; Anna is highly salient in the immediate context (Clark, 1996). Listeners will need to rely on subtler mutual salience to determine whether “it” refers to the party, some particular present, or something else entirely (Clark, 1996).\nIn the present study, we do not directly probe how interlocutors use focal points in conversation. Instead, we informally replicate Schelling’s first survey (Schelling, 1960). We consider both the results of our survey and of Schelling’s survey to theorize how these generalized points of mutual salience may add to our understanding of the implicit coordination facilitating everyday conversation."

    "text": "Materials\nSchelling’s classroom survey asked students questions challenging them to ambiguously “win” a game by coordinating with a stranger. Famously, he asked where and when the participants would meet a stranger in New York City without any prior communication. Additionally, the survey included a series of questions encouraging convergence on a response in more “game-like” circumstances: guessing a number, flipping a coin, etc.\nThe survey in this report was in essence an abbreviated version of Schelling’s. It included a selection of the “game-like” questions taken directly from Schelling’s survey. We asked the classic where-and-when questions with some revisions. Because our survey was conducted at the University of Chicago, our version of the where-and-when question asked about meeting a stranger in Chicago rather than New York City. We additionally included two follow-up questions that were not included in Schelling’s data, changing the interpersonal context between the participant and hypothetical partner."

    "text": "Thomas Schelling introduced the concept of “focal points” in The Strategy of Conflict with the intention of expanding the contemporary perspectives of game theory to include cooperative, not just competitive, games in human decision making (Schelling, 1960). Though his work certainly proved influential in this regard, concepts of focal points and coordination games have found relevance well beyond game theory and economics as a whole. From improvisational music (Canonne, 2018) to urban planning (Rondinelli, 1983), from human-computer interfacing (Wong et al., 2009) to linguistic anthropology (Brown & Levinson, 1987), from social stereotyping (Yoon & Hollingshead, 2010) to online gaming (Ross & Collister, 2014), elements of Schelling’s framework of coordinated decision-making seem ubiquitous.\nWe constructed a survey modeled after Schelling’s original report. Schelling himself did not perform a true “study” in reporting his results, but rather loosely surveyed the graduate students in his class at Yale in the 1950s (precise year unclear). Our data collection was similarly gathered quite loosely. The survey data were collected with the intention of serving a pedagogical purpose and with no intention to be published as rigorous study. While we cannot use these data to make empirical claims, they are nonetheless a useful and thought-provoking educational tool (as Schelling’s data certainly were).\n\n\nThis page reports responses from all MA students since 2023.\nYou can also view responses from:\n\nAll participants\nCurrent MAPSS students (Fall 2024)\n\n\n\n\nResponses have been cleaned to account for predictable variations in how individuals input popular responses – e.g., “the reg”, “Regenstein”, and “In the Reg.” are all reported as “The Reg.” Ambiguous responses (e.g., “the library”) are left ambiguous.
