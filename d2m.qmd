**FYI:** This is a version of the syllabus used for D2M in Winter 2024. It's here temporarily while I rework the class site through its own repo. That means:

1. There are __*major*__ changes to the structure of the class for Winter 2025! So if you're planning to take the course next Winter don't be misled by what you see here.
2. There are very likely lots of broken links, css, and bootstrap elements as a result of the quick and dirty migration from the old-school RMarkdown format to the Quarto format used on this site. This is a temporary site and I'm not going to fix them.

**From Data to Manuscript (D2M) in R**

*Winter 2024: CHDV 20550/30550, MACS 30550, MAPS 30550, PSYC 20550/30550*

## Overview

### Description

This course tackles the basic skills needed to build an integrated research report with the R programming language. We will cover every step from data to manuscript including: Using Râ€™s libraries to clean up and re-format messy datasets, preparing data sets for analysis, running statistical tools, generating clear and attractive figures and tables, and knitting those bits of code together with your manuscript writing. The result will be a reproducible, open-science friendly report that you can easily update after finishing data collection or receiving comments from readers. Never copy-paste your way through a table again! The R universe is large, so this course will focus specifically on: The core R libraries, the tidyverse library, and R Markdown. Students will also learn about the use of GitHub for version control.

#### Hubs:
  
  - [Course site & syllabus](https://nrdowling.github.io/d2m/) (you are here!)
  - [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lqikn4pfk085w8/)
  - [Canvas](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/54329)
  - [Example repo: schelling-games](https://github.com/nrdowling/schelling-games)
    - Duplicate this repo to poke around a (mostly) functional github pages site created entirely using R Markdown. Most of the .Rmd and .R files include extensive commenting, including some ideas for how you can practice coding by revising or adding to those R scripts directly. (I recommend duplicating rather than mirroring. [Set up a new repo via "import"](https://github.com/new/import) using the same url copied from the green code tab. You'll have a completely different repo -- no need to worry about messing up the original. If you just clone it, it will still be attached to the original, but your changes still won't push because you aren't a collaborator.) 
  - [Class repo: d2m-2024](https://github.com/nrdowling/d2m-2024)
    - Begins empty at the start of the quarter. Will be updated with in-class demos and data as we go.


### Course materials

  - Most required readings will be drawn from one of the following great (and free! and online!) resources:
    - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham
    - [R Markdown for Scientists](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/) by Nicholas Tierney
    - Also check out [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund
  - Additional resources can be found on the [resources page](resources.html)
  

### Dataset

Nearly all assignments in this course will involve working with a dataset of your choice. We will begin with setting up a repo for your data and R scripts, then move to tidying the data, then to analyzing and plotting the data, and finally to interpreting the results based on those data. In other words, having an appropriate dataset as early as possible is essential. <span style="color:red">You will get the most out of this class if you work with your own data for a project you will continue to be invested in after the end of the quarter, like a BA or MA thesis, grant proposal, or manuscript intended for publication.</span> If you are not currently working on this type of project, you should consider taking this class next year (or whenever you *do* have data). Whether or not you use your own data, you are responsible for providing your dataset. Read the [dataset selection guidelines](dataset-guidelines.html) for more information.


## Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:

  - Short assignments: 60% (graded complete/incomplete, 3% each)
  - Scientific report: 20% (including 2 ungraded preparatory tasks)
  - Participation: 20% (including self-assessment)

### Assignments

There is a short assignment for each lecture. Each assignment will involve working with your own data, data provided for that assignment, or both and is designed to give you hands-on practice with using R. Assignments typically begin in class and may be completed after class (each one is highlighted in <span style="color:#CB7E45">orange</span>) on a pass/fail basis. Students must push their completed assignment to the appropriate GitHub repository, tagging and Dr. Dowling (\@nrdowling) and Grace (\@ysh627) with the assignment number so that they receive a notification. There are 20 assignments total, each worth 3% of your final grade.

Assignment details are included at the end of the lecture slides.

_When are the assignments due?_
We will usually start assignments in class. Anything you don't finish during class time should be completed before the start of the next class meeting. If an assignment is listed under "pre-class preparation," it should (hopefully unsurprisingly) be completed in preparation for the start of that class.

_Need help?_ We will do much of this work in class, so ask your questions while we're together. Each student will be assigned to a support group of other students to help answer questions (in addition to access to help from Dr. Dowling and Grace during office hours). A large portion of the course is developing your search skills when it comes to debugging your code ([look for advice and solutions from others who have faced similar problems on sites like stackoverflow and github](https://xkcd.com/979/))! Week 2 slides will include a formal procedure to follow for troubleshooting help.

### Scientific report

Your final assignment will be a scientific report in R Markdown that is developed via a GitHub repository and includes:

  1. data read-in, pre-processing, and analysis
  2. at least 2 figures and 1 table with captions and in-text references
  3. at least 2 in-text R code references
  4. BibTeX citations
  5. at least 1500 words of the manuscript in at least four subsections (Introductions, Methods, Results, Discussion; unless otherwise agreed with Dr. Dowling). 

Additional details about report requirements will be provided throughout the quarter.

Items on the syllabus in <span style="color:#93A14D">green</span> indicate preparatory tasks for your final report: receiving approval for your dataset (by Tuesday of Week 2) and negotiating a manuscript plan (by Friday of Week 7). Each requires you to submit something informal via Canvas. These tasks are not graded, but grading for your final report will be contingent on completing both on time. <span style="color:red">Failing to meet with me for a report meeting will result in an automatic 10 points off your final report grade.</span>

### Participation

Students earn participation credit through their attendance and participation in their support group and discussion of course content in office hours. Students are generally expected to come to class prepared to practice using R together. That means you should come with your charged laptop, prepared with any data you are using and any installed software that is required (see the 'preparation' note for each class). Be prepared to share your screen with your support group and with the instructors. That said, please stay in touch about your limitations regarding in-person participation and/or technology access.

This grade is not an attendance grade. It is much more important that you care for your mental and physical health and the health of those around you than it is to check the "came to class" box. Please do not come to class if you are ill, but DO contact Dr. Dowling and Grace at least 24 hours in advance of an absence, when possible. Missing classes without notifying us may result in a lower participation grade. If your attendance is low enough to impact your work (with or without notifying us) you will need to meet with Dr. Dowling to discuss how it may affect your grade.

#### Self-assessment

At the end of the quarter you will write a brief reflection (1-2 paragraphs) on your participation in this class and assign yourself a grade (out of 20).

Your self-assigned grade may or may not end up as your final participation grade, but it will be *strongly* taken into consideration.

#### Grading

Participation grades will be posted to this assignment at the same time your final scientific report is graded. Once assigned, **participation grades are final**. If you are concerned about your grade you should reach out to Dr. Dowling or Grace before the end of the quarter, who can give you guidance on ways to increase this part of your grade. 

### Late work & attendance

Life happens. Family emergencies, exams for other courses, COVID-19, roommates in crisis...

If you need an extension, just ask. Send an email to Dr. Dowling (cc Grace) *as far in advance as possible* explaining what's going on (vague!) and how much extra time you need (specific). **It is never necessary to provide details about your physical or mental health.** You are always welcome to have an open discussion about what you're dealing with in office hours, but in your emails about absences it is more than sufficient to just say you're sick or having a personal emergency. 

With prior notice and instructor approval, late work will not be penalized. Students who register for the class after one or more assignments were already due should contact Dr. Dowling to arrange an extended deadline.

Without notice and/or approval, or after the agreed upon extended deadline: 

  1. Short assignments will be graded as incomplete, receiving 0 (of 3) points.
  2. Final scientific reports will lose 1 (of 20) points per 12 hours late.

If you will be missing class for any reason, email **both** Dr. Dowling and Grace before the start of class. **<span style="color:red">Please do not come to class if you are feeling at all ill.</span>** You do not need to be specific about why you will be absent, but please do give a guess as to when you'll be back in class and whether you'll be able to work remotely while you're out.

_Stressed out by emailing professors? Here are some good examples of what is helpful for your instructors._

> I have exams in two other classes 5th week. Is it ok if I take an extra 48 hours to turn in Assignment 5? 

> I just found out I need to quarantine after a COVID exposure. No positive test as of now, so I'll plan on missing classes Tuesday and Thursday but completing the assignments at home. I'll let you know if anything changes.

> I have a family emergency and need to travel home. I won't be able to work while I'm home and I'm not sure how long I'll need to be away. Can we meet over Zoom to make a plan to handle late assignments and absences? 


## Course schedule

This schedule is subject to change. Refer to this page for syllabus updates (including new and updated links, files, etc.) throughout the quarter. Slides will typically be posted the morning of class.

For each day of class the schedule below includes an overview of what we'll cover in class and any key information you'll need for that day.

**The accordion boxes contain detailed information about all tasks you should complete.** These boxes will describe things you need to do *both before and after that class,* so you should always read details at least one class ahead. Tasks are color coded:

- <span style="color:#99414D">Ungraded assignments, preparatory tasks, readings, and resources are in burgundy. Required readings are marked with as asterisk and should be completed before start of class.</span>
- <span style="color:#CB7E45">Graded assignments due before the start of next class (unless otherwise noted) are in orange.</span>
- <span style="color:#93A14D">Preparatory tasks for the final project are in green.</span>
- <span style="color:#4E6988">Extra information necessary for that class period is in blue.</span>



### Module 1: Fundamentals of R and GitHub

  - Set up your GitHub repo w/ RStudio
    - Create a local R project by cloning a GitHub repo
      - Follow the *EXTREMELY DETAILED* [instructions for Using GitHub with RStudio](rstudio-github.html) and troubleshoot as needed
      - Give your repo a relevant name! (e.g., 'child-gesture-study', *NOT* 'thesis' or 'd2m')
    - Invite \@nrdowling (Natalie) and \@ysh627 (Grace) as collaborators to your repo

- Install the tidyverse and papaja packages
- Create an R script file (.R) that:
  - Loads the tidyverse and papaja packages
  - *REQUIRES* 1+ other package of your choice
  - Includes 1+ lines of commented text
  - Assigns 1+ numeric variable and 1+ string/character variable
  - BONUS: Create a dataframe 
- Create an R Notebook *with the Papaja template*
  - Change the title and author fields at the top
  - `source()` your R script in the first code chunk
- **FOR THIS AND ALL GRADED ASSIGNMENTS:** Commit (with an informative message) and push to GitHub tagging Dr. Dowling and Grace
- Ungraded final step (no submission): knit .Rmd to Word doc or PDF and troubleshoot as needed
- **Above-and-beyond:** Experiment with creating .Rmd files *without* papaja
  - We'll only use papaja in this class, but knowing how to make use of .Rmds with other outputs might be very useful for you. For example if you want to make an html page (like this one!) or produce manuscripts in non-APA styles.

Papaja installation (extra info)

:::
:::

::: {#papajacollapse .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w1c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Papaja installation is trickier than other packages for a few reasons:
  - ~~It is not currently available through CRAN and so cannot be installed with the install.packages() function.~~ Papaja is now available through CRAN! Hooray! That means you can install it just like anything else, with the function `install.packages("papaja")`. These directions for installing it directly from the source will still work, but the CRAN installation should be much simpler. 
  - It requires manually setting up a TeX distribution â€“ like TinyTex (recommended), MikTeX, MacTeX, or TeX Live â€“ which can have their own installation issues.
  - Because the installation is a relatively involved process, it can be difficult to determine exactly where in the process errors are occurring.
- So what are you supposed to do about it?
  - Follow the installation guide in papaja's detailed documentation. I recommend starting with this guide rather than going to it when you hit a problem. Past students have encountered an issue where once their TeX distribution was installed in an incompatible way, they couldn't undo it.
  - If it doesn't install smoothly, set a timer for 1 hour and do your best to troubleshoot the issue. If you can't fix it in that time, makes notes on what you've done so far and what you think might still be going wrong and then stop messing with it.
- Adjust your assignment submission as follows:
  - Create an .Rmd with the default Notebook template (& update the YAML title field)
  - Include the line of code that would load the papaja package, then comment out that line
  - Add your notes from above about the state of the installation

Dataset approval

:::
:::

::: {#dataapproval .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w1c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Review the [dataset guidelines](dataset-guidelines.html)
- Once you are confident your dataset meets the requirements, request approval via email by Friday Jan 5 at 11:59pm:
  - Send the email to Dr. Dowling (ndowling \@ uchicago.edu) and cc Grace (ysh \@ uchicago.edu)
  - Subject line should be: `(Your first & last name) Dataset Selection`
- Your email should include:
  - A brief (2-4 sentences) description of your data
  - The data itself, in whole or part; this may be an attached .csv file, a link to a shared document, or instructions for where to find the data on the github repo you have already invited us to
    - If you are unable to share the data with us via email (due to IRB limitations or anonymization concerns), explain this issue and a tentative plan for how you will get the data into a sharable state (i.e., any data necessary to run your analyses is included in a private github repo) within one week  
  - *At least* one research question you tentatively plan to ask that can be answered with this dataset in the state it is currently in
    - Specifically, your question should be answerable with an outcome variable in your data *right now*
    - It's ok if it's a boring question, and it's ok if you do not end up answering this question in your final project
- Once you receive a reply approving your data from either Dr. Dowling or Grace, complete the Canvas assignment to receive completion credit
  - Due before class on Tuesday Jan 9th 11am, meaning you will need to have gotten approval over the weekend
  - In the text box, include a brief but descriptive name for your dataset and the sender (Dr. Dowling/Grace) and timestamp of the approval email
- **NOTE:** If you received approval for your dataset when you requested enrollment consent, you do not need to request it again. Simply complete the Canvas assignment to receive credit.

#### Tuesday, January 9 2024 (2.1)

##### Pre-class preparation

Take the weekend to catch up on any pre-quarter preparation tasks not yet completed. It is critical that you are fully caught up by today or you will not be able to follow along with demos and assignments. Additionally, confirm that your dataset approval is marked as complete on Canvas (contact Dr. Dowling if it is not marked as complete by start of class).

Assignment (3) README.md & .gitignore

:::
:::

::: {#assign3 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w2c1"}
::: {.accordion-body}

  - Part 1: README
    - Create a README.md file in the top level of your repo if it doesn't exist
    - Edit your README to include:
      - A brief description of your data
      - A brief overview of your planned project
      - A real or hypothetical file tree
        - Format of your choosing
        - This can be extremely simple, but should demonstrate you've thought about how plan to keep your repo organized.
    - At a minimum, your README should include the following markdown elements:
      - 1 header (any level)
      - **bold** *italics* or ~~strikethough~~
  - Part 2: .gitignore
    - Create a .gitignore file in the top level of your repo if it does not exist
      - You can start with GitHub's default R .gitignore template
    - Edit the .gitignore to include:
      - A dedicated directory called localonly
      - All files of specific types that you want on your computer but don't want to upload to GitHub
      - One specific file that is not in an ignored folder and is not an ignored filetype
    - Add a comment for each

**NOTE:** A primary goal of this assignment is for you to practice answering your own questions. We have not formally covered either of these files in detail. It's you job to figure out the point and the implementation of each. There will be a slide in the W2C2 lecture with "verbose" instructions for the .gitignore. Do your best at this point, then make adjustments as needed after next class.

Assignment (4) `hello_world()` function

:::
:::

::: {#assign4 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w2c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Create a hello_world() function in an .R script dedicated to defining functions
  - This should be the script you eventually source in your .Rmd with project-specific functions (if necessary)
- Your function should include:
  - 1+ object assignment
  - 1+ conditional statement
  - CHALLENGE: 1+ for or while loop
- Your functions should take at least 1 argument, such as:
  - name (string)
  - time_of_day (numeric or POSIX)
  - is_morning (boolean)
  - return_n_greetings (integer)
- Your function should have at least 2 possible return values, such as:
  - hello, class
  - Good morning, Dr. Dowling!
  - Sup?
  - bonjour mes amis
- Feel free to get creative here! This will feel less tedious if you can make yourself laugh while you do it. (It will make grading more enjoyable, too.)

Assignment (5) YAML, markdown, code chunk

:::
:::

::: {#assign5 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w2c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Update the YAML header of your .Rmd, minimally:
  - Title
  - Short title
  - Author(s)
- Call your hello_world() function within your .Rmd:
  - source() the R script where you defined the function
  - Add a chunk that calls the function
  - Don't forget to follow [best practices](best-practices.html) for naming and placing chunks!
- Add/edit markdown to include at least ([lorem ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) is ok):
  - 1st, 2nd, & 3rd headers (1 of each)
  - 1 unordered list & 1 ordered list
  - Bold & italicized text
  - 1 linked URL
  - 1 HTML-style comment

Assignment (6) Data read-in and -out, tidy data evaluation

:::
:::

::: {#assign6 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w3c1"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Create (or update) a code chunk in your .Rmd for data read-in 
  - Use readr to read in your data (and any supplementary data files you may have)
  - Don't forget to give your chunk a unique and informative name!
- Examine your dataset in RStudio. Answer these questions with comments in your read-in chunk
  - Is it tidy? Remember that "tidy" means:
    - Each column is a single variable
    - Each row is a single observation
    - Each cell is a single measurement
  - If not, what data wrangling is necessary to tidy it?
  - Which variables, observations, and measurements in your data are absolutely necessary for your plans? Which are (likely) extraneous?
- Create (and name!) a code chunk to create an intermediate dataset
  - Use 2+ dplyr functions
  - Use readr to write your intermediate dataset to a .csv, .xlsx, or other tabular filetype
- Examine your new intermediate data file in Excel (or similar)

::: {#assign7 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w3c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Conceptualize the dataset you'll need to create <span style="color:purple">(this is just to get started, not a submission)</span>. Some ideas (not tasks!) to help get you thinking:
  - Draw out a couple mock figures you'd like to include and/or articulate your research questions and hypotheses
  - How will you need to organize your variables (and within-variable groups) to produce those figures and/or analyses? What data types will your variables need to be?   - Does anything that currently looks like string, numeric, or logical data need to be handled as factor?
- Mockup a preliminary dataset & begin prep - **PUSH TO YOUR REPO**:
  - A tabular mock-up of your ideal data structure. Create this in Excel (or similar) either by manipulating your actual data manually or creating fully mock data
    - You *can* do this in R if you want, but the goal is more to get a solid concept of data structure rather than actually executing the data wrangling
  - Building on or replacing the code you wrote in assignment (6), create an .R script called `data-prep.R`: 
    - Use comments to write out in plain English the prep steps you expect to carry out in order to make your existing data look like your mock-up, including data import, wrangling, and exporting intermediate datasets
    - Make note of anything that you know you'll need to do conceptually but don't yet know how to execute in R
    - Begin to fill in the parts of your data prep you feel comfortable starting, e.g., import/export, filtering/selecting, object assignment

##### Pre-class preparation

- No new material! Aside from a brief discussion about final projects, the whole class will be time to work on data preparation with support from your group and instructors. Review and adjust your plans from assignment (7) ahead of time to make the best use of your time.


##### Class meeting

<!-- [slides](...) -->

  - Brief discussion of final report requirements
  - Lab: Data Manipulation in the Tidyverse
  - Assignments: 
    - <span style="color:#CB7E45">(9) Finish prepping your data!</span>
      - Before your final commit, be sure that your scripts include sufficient and informative comments
    - <span style="color:#CB7E45">(10) Imagine two plots you would like to see of your data. Add comment blocks into your rmd describing (in plain English, not code) what elements will be necessary to create each plot.</span>

Assignment (9) Finish prepping your data

:::
:::

::: {#assign9 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w4c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

Finish preparing your data for analysis and presentation! Use tidyverse tools to create the mock-up data you created in Assignment (7). Be sure your data frames(s) is/are in a tidy, long format. In particular, as you imagine plots you'd like to create in Assignment (10), be sure that any measures you want to include on x or y axes are each in one column and that any groups you might want to compare against each other are in one column

e.g.: You want to compare number of gestures used by parents and children. Your original <span style="color:red">*wide, untidy*</span> dataset includes 2 measurement columns: `parent_gestures` and `child_gestures`. Your <span style="color:green">*long, tidy*</span> has one `speaker` column with values `parent` and `child` and one `n_gestures` column with the number of gestures produced by that subject at the observation.

Assignment (10) Mock up 2 plots

:::
:::

::: {#assign10 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w4c2"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Mock up 2 plots (of 2 different types) you could include in your final report
  - Add code chunks to your .Rmd for each plot and give each a unique, informative name
  - Add plain-English comments within your chunks explaining the goal for the plot. To start thinking about this, ask yourself questions like: 
    - What variables are on the axis/axes? 
    - What kind of plot is it? 
    - Will you need to compare across groups?
    - What would you anticipate seeing if your hypotheses were borne out in your analyses?
- Create a visual of each mock-up that render in your .Rmd when you knit. This can be either:
  - A first attempt at the ggplot code itself if you are already familiar with ggplot
  - .jpg/.gif/.png files created outside R (e.g., in Excel, in MS paint, sketched by hand or on an iPad) and called in the text below the corresponding code chunk using R markdown
    - Look back at the slides or the R Markdown cheatsheet if you don't remember how to insert an image file!

      - Did you use the best kind of plot to tell the story you're hoping to tell?
      - Did you have to do some wonky wrangling to plot what you wanted?
      - Are there adjustments you could make to scale, coord, or labs layers that would make things easier to read?
      - Are you effectively making use of groups? Could you communicate your point better by grouping in a different way (e.g., color, shape, fill, facet)?
    Add code to one chunk created in Assignment (10)
      - Add/edit comments to make note of what you want to do to make your plot "pretty" like customizing colors or fonts, tweaking the theme, or relabeling in the legend
    - Add in the second plot you planned in Assignment (10). At a minimum, replicate what you did in Assignment (11) for the first plot. Add some "tune-ups" if you can!

Assignment (13) Part 1: Recreate this plot (advanced & terrible)

:::
:::

::: {#assign13-1 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w6c1"}
::: {.accordion-body}


  - <span style="color:red">**submit BOTH tasks to receive credit for Assignment (13)!**</span> Commit your final submission of both at the same time in just one commit
  - **Part 1: Recreate this plot**
    - In your existing `starwars.R` file from Assignments (8), (11), & (12), replicate this using dplyr and ggplot2 functions (these can be found in the `d2m-2024` repo)
      - [Plot 1](https://github.com/nrdowling/d2m-2024/blob/main/images/plots/assign13.png)
    - You do not need to save this as an image file
    - If plotting the dataset you created in Assignment (8) isn't working as expected, reproduce it with the code provided during the class walkthrough
    - <span style="color:red">There's a **lot** going on visually in this plot.</span> Start by creating a base plot with just the required `aes()` mappings and geoms, then making a commented list of all the different modifications you can spot, whether or not you have any idea how to replicate them. Some hints:
      - You'll need 13 elements in your `theme()` layer *after* setting one of the built-in themes
      - Install, load, and investigate the `ggsci` package to choose a scale layer
      - Look for a list of "web-safe font families" to find the right fonts
      - Neither the `limits` nor `breaks` arguments are required in your axis scales
      - Remember that facet text can't be modified in the `labs()` layer
      - You can use a color selector (i.e., eye-dropper) tool [like this one](https://get-color.com/image/) to identify precise colors
        - If something doesn't look right even with the precise hex code, it could be an effect of transparency ("alpha") somewhere along the way
    - Try to match as much as you can, but don't let it drive you crazy. Set a timer to keep working, then add/edit comments to describe what is still left to be done. Your completion grade is going to be based on putting in a good-faith effort, *not* getting a perfect replication

  - <span style="color:red">**submit BOTH tasks to receive credit for Assignment (13)!**</span> Commit your final submission of both at the same time in just one commit
  - **Part 2: Tune up your plots & .Rmd code chunks** 
    - Tune up the plots you made in Assignments (11) & (12), for example think about:
      - Did you use the best kind of plot to tell the story you're hoping to tell?
      - Did you have to do some wonky wrangling to plot what you wanted?
      - Are there adjustments you could make to scale, coord, or labs layers that would make things easier to read?
      - Are you effectively making use of groups? Could you communicate your point better by grouping in a different way (e.g., color, shape, fill, facet)?
    - "Prettify" your plots with `scale_*()`, `theme()`, and `labs()` layers, as well as "aesthetic" non-aesthetics (i.e., visual attributes outside the `aes()` and so not mapped to your data)
    - Use code chunks in your .Rmd to render publication-ready plots when knit that:
      - Are in their own uniquely named chunks
      - Have a caption defined and referenced in the chunk's fig.cap option
      - Include appropriate and reader-friendly labels and text (no inscrutable axis or level names!)
      - Include a theme layer with 1+ customized element (e.g., font, legend placement, background color)
    - **Bonus:** Add a chunk that reads in one image file, like a photo, diagram, or saved ggplot
      - Give it a chunk caption just like with your plot chunks

      - More than one of either or both works too! Just make sure you have at least one of each
    - For anything we covered in class today (descriptives and basic hypothesis testing), create as complete and polished code as possible
    - For anything more advanced, explore the `psych`, `lme4`, and `stats` packages and give it your best shot based on the info you can find. You'll clean it up after Thursday's class.

Assignment (17) Create a partial draft of methods/results with 5 in-line code references

:::

::: {.accordion-body}


- Complete the code chunks for the two analysis chunks you have been working on in Assignments (15) and (16)
- In the narrative of your R Markdown manuscript, include at least *5* in-line code references
    - By "in-line code" I mean using R Markdown to interpret some text *outside of a code chunk* as R code, so that it runs it as code and displays the resulting output as fully in-line in your regular old text
        - Look at the `stats-demo.Rmd` file in the `d2m-2024` repo for lots of examples! Anything that starts with ``r `` is what I mean here.
        - Remember that just using backticks without the `r` is just formatting, not code. (Everything on this page that looks like code in monospaced font is done that way.)
    - At least 1 of these in-line code refs should "do something." In other words, it should be more than just a value reference; it should include a function.
        - Examples of value calls: 
            - `` `r knitr::inline_expr("model$p.value")` ``
            - `` `r knitr::inline_expr("median_mpg")` ``
            - `` `r knitr::inline_expr('mass_height_corr3$ci2[["r"]]')` ``
        - Examples of in-line function code: 
            - `` `r knitr::inline_expr("apa_p(model$p.value)")` ``
            - `` `r knitr::inline_expr("nrow(filter(mtcars, mpg > median(mpg)))")` ``

:::
:::

::: {#assign18 .accordion-collapse .collapse data-bs-parent="#w8c1"}
::: {.accordion-body}

- Finish downloading and setting up Zotero, Better BibTeX, and the `citr` package add-on
- Create a .bib file 
    - Since you've been working in a papaja document all quarter, it's likely a .bib file was automatically generated or that you made a blank one so that your .Rmd would knit properly. If so, you can continue to use that one or create a new one, just make sure it is named appropriately and referenced correctly in the .Rmd where needed
    - Use the papaja default (`r-references.bib`) or give it some other sensible name
- Add 5+ relevant references for your manuscript
    - Try to do different entry types if you can (journal article, book, book chapter, conference paper, etc.)
    - *Already wrote a lit review for your project/proposal?* Great! You don't need to rewrite it. You can copy and paste your existing work into your RMarkdown notebook, edit formatting as needed, and then swap out the in-text citations you wrote out manually for dynamic bibtex references
- Knit your .Rmd to .pdf and confirm that the citations render as expected
    - Error messages? Add/edit/check the name of your .bib file in the YAML header
    - Unexpected formatting?
        - Check your .bib file to see if the problem is in that file (in which case, correct it)
        - If not, debug by pinpointing the problem and following the troubleshooting guidelines from W2

Building on Assignment (18), continue adding BibTeX references to your literature review (or anywhere in your narrative text). Your repo should now include (among other things):

- A .bib file with at least 10 BibTeX entries
    - With at least 3 different source types (e.g., article, book, conference paper, policy memo, etc.)
- A papaja .Rmd with at least 10 in-text bibtex references
    - With at least 3 different formats (e.g., adding extra text, using year only, including chapters, etc.)
    - You can rewrite or remove unnecessary extra formats later for your final project, but use them in this assignment for the sake of practice
- A .pdf file created when you knit your papaja notebook rendering all bibtex references error free
    - Everything is correctly APA formatted both in the text (e.g., alphabetical order, no random text, last names only, etc.) and the entries in the references section
    - There are no formatting or input errors in the bibtex entries (e.g., broken special characters, incorrect capitalization, missing or misattributed fields, etc.)

This includes, but is not limited to, accommodations around the format of course materials, the use of Canvas and other digital resources, the classroom and other physical resources, and the structure of assignments.

I will work with you to create an accessible learning environment whether or not you disclose your disability or personal circumstances. If you choose to disclose personal information with me, I will keep those discussions confidential. For certain accommodations you may need to contact Student Disability Services at (773) 702-6000 or disabilities\@uchicago.edu. If you have a documented disability (or think you may have a disability) and, as a result, need a reasonable accommodation to participate in class, complete course requirements, or benefit from the University's programs or services, I encourage you to contact Student Disability Services.

### Diversity, Inclusion, and Community

We will commit as a class to creating a welcoming, respectful, and productive classroom. We will expect each other to be mutually respectful of our meaningful identities. I expect that when we engage with each other in discussion we are considerate of the diversity of our classroom with regards to gender, sexuality, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, immigration status, and language. It is critical that we maintain respectful dialogue in the classroom, which includes using correct names and pronouns. If a member of our community â€“ including myself â€“ is creating an unwelcome space for you, I hope you will bring this to my attention immediately.
